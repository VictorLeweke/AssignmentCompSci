# AssignmentCompSci
Our project for computer science modelling course

This is the first part of the project; we have AST types, parser and lexer, and defined both a pretty printer ("prettyPrinter") and a prototype for creating the graph ("treeWalker"). Run the entire code in F#, and enter the desired GCL to see it printed!
