Our project for computer science modelling course

This is the third part of the project; we have AST types, parser and lexer, and 
have defined a wrapper function, which prompts the user to first enter a GCL expression, and afterwards enter 
the initial conditions similarly to the formalmethods website.

Clone the repository from branch Part 3 / download the .zip file, and run the entire code "ProjectPart3.fsx" in F#, and enter the desired GCL to have it evaluated!
The GCL should not have any newlines.
By changing the 'N' argument in the wrapper function to 'D', you can run it deterministically.

The FSLexYacc should be installed in the same directory as the files.
